# HTMLON

[Dumentation & demo](https://mitya.uk/projects/htmlon)

HTMLON (pronounced HT-em-elon, like the, er, fruit) is a JavaScript-powered rich text editor in the vein of (but much simpler and smaller than) Tiny MCE. It doesn't really need to exist; yet it does, so here we are.

**HTMLON is based on `execCommand()`, which is deprecated. This project is therefore no longer maintained.**
